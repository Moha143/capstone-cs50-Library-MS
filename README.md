# CS50W CAPSTONE PROJECT

A library management system is software that is designed to manage all the functions of a library. It helps librarian to maintain the database of new books and the books that are borrowed by members along with their due dates. It tracks the records of the number of books in the library, how many books are available, or how many books have been returned or late fine charges, etc.
